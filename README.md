# SvelteKit Data Loading in Action

when it comes to data loading, the [SvelteKit documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/load) is quite comprehensive, seeing it in action helps demystify the concepts.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run: `npm i`

## Running the app

1. Run `npm run start:log-server` in one terminal.
2. Run `npm run dev` in another terminal.
3. Open the application in browser, watch the log-server terminal and explore the source.

:metal: Happy coding :metal:
